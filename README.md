I struggled on this two weeks ago and I really don't feel I have gotten any closer to understanding this so some guidance would be much appreciated.

SERVER | The coding and set up and was all fine up until the point of the API fetch of data from my Supabase database. I got absolutely lost and ran out of time. I clearly don't understand this area of the course. I did however manage to
